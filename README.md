# ParkingBlock

I created this simple app to help my co-workers with their parking habits. 
From time to time someone would block, without knowing, someone elses car and in order to know who's car it was, it would take a lenghty
search within company offices. 
With this app you need only to search the cars tags or the owners name and it would send a SMS to the owner requesting to move the car.
If you have any issues with people that dont want others to know there contact info, this app will not show such information.
